      <div class="para">Eutrophication is a condition in which there is excess algal bloom in a body of water. It is caused by chemical runoff from urban areas and agriculture fields. These chemicles are mostly composed of nitrogen based fertilizers. These fertilizers find their way into the drainage system. Once there, they reach the water bodies where they are dumped. Due to global warming, hotter temprature, and nutrition rich water body, algal bloom is found. They cover the body for miles and cause devastion to the water body. This problem has plagued states and countries like Texas, California, Mexico, Michigan, Ohio, Canada, Pennsylvania and Newyork. We should all work as a community to save these beautiul landmarks.s</div>
