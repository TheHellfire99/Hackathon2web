      <div class="lastpara">So as we all know that Eutrophication and Red Tides are caused by pesticide and chemical runoffs into the ocean or into a lake or pond. In order to reduce the amount of chemical flow into the water. States should adopt a vermicomposting project. Vermicomposting reduces food waste being dumped into the ocean and also methane being released into the air. Vermicomposting is also a natural way of making fertilizer that don't release nitrogen. They also help in fertilizing the land. So agriculture can be boosted in the state. Which can increases revenue and more funding to the state. We can also focus on building awareness and raising funds to save these marvelous sites</div>
